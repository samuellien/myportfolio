                <h1>My story: Why I want to become a web developer?</h1>

                <p>Since 2011 I was looking for the place or the education centers to learn computer ( programming) there are some computer learning classes but those could not give me what I really want to learn.There are also some Universitys and College but I was rejected.But those didn't stop me from learning programming. Since 2015 I started learning the coding or programming through online sites and YouTube it's quite hard to learned through, because I cannot ask all the questions I have to the online teachers.There are times that I stop because I have nowhere to overcome.But those hardship gave me more willingness of learning.One of my friend introduce me about this class and I am very interested and excited to be involve in the class. Joining this class will give me all the programming knowledge and skills to become the programer.More over I can ask many questions in person.I want to become web developer because it is worldwide market demand and my passion to deal with.</p>
